# ClientInfoCapture
I have an assignment for a simple client info capture for C#, everything seem to work except the portion wherein it should only accept 3 digits,  I entered 4 or more and it still accepts it, anyone can check if my code is correct? I did my due diligence and googled but still not working for some reason


The client will have four pieces of information as follows:
 A client ID (string,) stores a 3 digit numerical string of characters -------------------> **this one somehow is the one I cant figure out**
 A first name (string) stores the client first name
 A last name (string) stores the client last name
 Purchase amount (double) stores the purchase amount that the client has spent
